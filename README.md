# Julia Data Analysis YouTube Series

This code goes along with the YouTube Series from Daniel Lakeland / LakelandAppliedSciences 

We step you through setting up Julia, getting data, doing exploratory analysis, graphing,
and model fitting... While simultaneously discussing how the Julia ecosystem and language works.

You can view output of the [CASchools analysis here](CASchools/AnalyzeTests.html)

You can also see the [Basics of Mathematical Modeling with Uncertainty](CASchools/BasicsOfModeling.html) presentation.
