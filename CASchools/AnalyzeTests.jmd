# Getting Started With Julia for Data Analysis

In this project, we will download some files from the CA dept of Education which give averaged results for test scores in all schools in CA across various student groups within the schoool.

The data is available at: https://caaspp-elpac.cde.ca.gov/caaspp/ResearchFileListSB?ps=true&lstTestYear=2021&lstTestType=B&lstCounty=00&lstDistrict=00000#dl

We are going to get the Los Angeles county files which avoids unnecessary data.

Unfortunately some years have different "versions" and there is no way on the site to get a list of files, so we need to just by hand click through and find out the file names, for example:

https://caaspp-elpac.cde.ca.gov/caaspp/researchfiles/sb_ca2015_all_19_csv_v3.zip for 2014-2015 LA County

https://caaspp-elpac.cde.ca.gov/caaspp/researchfiles/sb_ca2021_all_19_csv_v2.zip for 2020-2021 LA County data...

there is no 2019-2020 data as COVID prevented the testing from happening.

```julia
versions = [2015 => 3, 2016 => 3, 2017 => 2, 2018 => 3, 2019 => 4 , 2021 => 2]


files = ["sb_ca$(vv[1])_all_19_csv_v$(vv[2]).zip" for vv in versions]
```

We also need the entity file that describes the codes for each school/district etc and the codes for the tests and student group descriptions
we'll assume for our analysis that none of the entities of interest changed during the time period and just get the recent ones.

```julia

push!(files,"sb_ca2021entities_csv.zip")
push!(files,"Tests.zip")
push!(files,"StudentGroups.zip")

```

# Downloading the files

We'll change directory into the data dir, download each of the files, unzip them, and then cd out of the directory. 

We use try/finally to ensure that we wind up in the same directory even if there's an error, then read the directory
to see what files we have...


```julia
try 
    cd("data")
    @showprogress 3 for f in files
        if ! ispath(f) # if we don't have the file already
            Downloads.download("https://caaspp-elpac.cde.ca.gov/caaspp/researchfiles/$(f)",f)
        end
        run(`unzip -u $(f)`)
    end
finally
    cd("..")
end

readdir("data")
```

# We have all the files

Next, we need to read the data in, and try to subset down to the schools of interest. Unfortunately, the files don't all have the same columns, nor do they have the same delimeters!
What do we do about that? DataFrames allows us to append!(df,df2) and handle the case where they don't have exactly the same columns by various methods by specifying the "cols" option (see docs)
cols=:union causes the resulting dataset to have all the columns from both files, but with missing values where needed

```julia

intify(s::Int64) = s
function intify(s)
    x = tryparse(Int64,s)
    if isnothing(x)
        missing
    else
        x
    end
end

floatormiss(x::Float64) = x
function floatormiss(x)
    if ismissing(x)
        return missing
    end
    if isa(x,String)
        let v = tryparse(Float64,x);
            if isnothing(v)
                missing
            else
                v
            end
        end
    end

We want points for each test... Test_ID = 1 means english, 2 means Math (for "smarter balanced" assessment). Let's group the tests by cohort, meaning Test_Year - (Grade - 3) basically 
the year they were in 3rd grade which is the first year you take the test.


```julia

```


Clearly there are some differences between schools. Since we are looking at the average across the school 
some of this will be because the demographic and socioeconomic mix of the students is different. 
For example the middle schoolers at the relative wealthy community of Sierra Madre Middle School are testing about the same 
as the high school 11th graders at Blair and Marshall Fundamental. 

Also Alhambra schools appear to have higher achievement in general. 

A considerable difference in overall average test scores can be attributed to a different mix
of students. So let's break down the schools by demographic groups. The Demographic_ID in 
the students table describes the Student_Groups. We can break this down by:

"Economically Disadvantaged" vs "Not economically disadvantaged"

Race and ethnicity

Parent Education Level

For now, let's focus on math scores, and we'll iterate over every school, and output a graph that shows 
the average curve for each parent education level:



```julia

function plotedlevel(schools,scores,dist)

    edlevnames = Dict(90 => "No HSD", 91 => "HSD", 92 => "Some College", 93 => "College Grad", 94=>"Grad School")

    for sch in eachrow(schools)
        ourdf = @subset(scores,:Test_Id .== 2 .&& :School_Code .== sch.School_Code .&& in.(:Subgroup_ID ,Ref(90:94)))
        p = @df ourdf scatter(:Grade,:Mean_Scale_Score; xlim=(2.5,12), ylim=(2300,2800),title="$(dist)\nMath $(sch.School_Name)\nBy Parent Ed",label=false,markersize=3,size=(500,500))
        for edlev in 90:94
            subs = @subset(ourdf,:Subgroup_ID .== edlev .&& .!ismissing.(:Grade) .&& .! ismissing.(:Mean_Scale_Score))
            if nrow(subs) < 4 
                continue
            end
            #println("There are $(nrow(subs)) observations for $(sch.School_Name)")
            grades = collect(minimum(subs.Grade):maximum(subs.Grade))
            if length(grades) > 2
                l = loess(Float64.(subs.Grade),Float64.(subs.Mean_Scale_Score))

# Let's summarize the result via a model

One reason to create a mathematical model is that it can simplify your understanding of a problem. For example a drag coefficient is
a kind of summary of the entire pressure field on the surface of an object... integrated together it results in a certain amount of drag.

In our case we will assume that variation from year to year is low, so that we can pool the years together, and get a summary of how quickly
students are learning math, by fitting a line through different groups of grades: (3,4,5) (6,7,8) and the level at grade 11 we can summarize the general trend 
in each school as just 5 numbers (levels and slopes of each group), rather than the details of potentially hundreds of measurements.

We will assume the level and slope of these three lines depends on parents education level only, since we don't have individual student
data with covariates where we could fit a more complicated model.
